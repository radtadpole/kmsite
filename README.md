## Hi, I'm Kyle!
I'm a geography student at the University of Oregon focusing on spatial analysis, cartography, and data visualizations. By combining mapping software, GIS tools, and design principles I strive to create visually compelling maps. 

On this site, you'll find:
- A little bit of information about me.

- Maps and graphics I've done for classes or in my free time experimenting with data and designs.
